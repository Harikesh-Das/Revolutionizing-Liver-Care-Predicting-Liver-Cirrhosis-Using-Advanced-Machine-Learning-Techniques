This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict liver cirrhosis based on patient health data. The goal is to provide a tool for early detection and diagnosis to aid in timely medical intervention. 

 Objectives:

•	To collect and preprocess patient health data.

•	To explore and analyze the data to understand key features.

•	To develop and evaluate different machine learning models.

•	To optimize and tune the selected model for better performance.

•	To integrate the model into a web application for easy accessibility.
