# Revolutionizing-Liver-Care-Predicting-Liver-Cirrhosis-Using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Techniques
1.1. Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict liver cirrhosis based on patient health data. The goal is to provide a tool for early detection and diagnosis to aid in timely medical intervention.
1.2. Objectives
•	To collect and preprocess patient health data.
•	To explore and analyze the data to understand key features.
•	To develop and evaluate different machine learning models.
•	To optimize and tune the selected model for better performance.
•	To integrate the model into a web application for easy accessibility.
